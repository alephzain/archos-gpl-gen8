	  djmount - mount MediaServers content as a Linux filesystem.
	  Created 23/04/2005, RÃ©mi Turboult <r3mi@users.sourceforge.net>
	  
	  djmount is a UPnP AV client. It mounts as a Linux filesystem (using FUSE)
	  the media content of compatible UPnP AV devices.
	  
	  djmount discovers automatically all UPnP AV Media Servers on the network,
	  and make the content available in a directory tree. All shared files 
	  (e.g. Audio or Video files) are directly visible and can be played using 
	  your favorite media player.
