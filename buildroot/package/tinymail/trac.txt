    Do unrefs in dispose, not finalise for tny-camel-folder and tny-camel-store-account.

mail 02 approved: 0001/r3767: 0002/r3730
    Give tny_folder_store_get_folders a refresh parameter, for optionally not refreshing from the server. Add tny_folder_store_refresh_async that will asynchronously refresh the store from the server, emitting TnyFolderStoreChanged events to observers. Implement it all for camel.

mail 03: 0002/r3767: 0003/r3730
    New observer behaviour. Observers will get folders_appeared events when a tny_folder_store_refresh or tny_folder_store_get_folders occurs and the cache is loaded for the first time. They get folders_created events when a new folder appears that we didn't know about before.

mail 03: 0002/r3767: 0004/r3730
    Notify observers about existing folders when they're attached.

    The known-folders hashtable for folder-store implementations should use weak references to avoid circular references.

    Bugfix in new folders_appeared code - first refresh of a store account was emitting folders as created and appeared.

    tny_camel_folder_store_refresh was leaking a reference to the account due to bad copy+paste.

    Make the sofar/oftotal field in TnyProgress more sensible when one of the is negative. In general one of these ill be negative right at the start of an operation, and if one is 0, then the other is generally gibberish, so 0/0 is more sensible.
