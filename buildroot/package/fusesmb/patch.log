Gen6 "sub-trunk" for maintenance.
Created at r56000.

 - AX06_trunk is for Gen6
 - trunk      is for Gen7

from AX05.

This issue with index/rindex is strange - it looks like "string.h/strings.h" is not taken from the right directory.

This branches is now the "trunk" for Gen5 development
(1.7 for now)
The actual trunk will now be used for Gen6 development.

Fix the new process based scanner. getpid() gives different results on NTPL (desktop)
and LinuxThreads (target)...

Also remove tmp files not cleaned up by previously aborted scanner processes.

Faster version of the smb scanner. The previous scanner was slow
because it had to lock calls into the libsmbclient (which is inherently
not-threadsafe). To get around this locking i rewrote the scanner to
use processes instead of threads. The scanning results are
aggregated with the help of some tmp files.

- Make the a process spawned by apopen a processgroupleader. The idea is that
  when we kill this process all processes spawned by that process itself will receive
  a signal.
- Better logging

an empty cache-file to disk so AVOS is happy.

Another speed improvement. Do not try to convert servers from ips to names
if allready know that the server string is not an ip-address.

- Bugfix: Workgroups were looked up two times in the case ctx->readdir worked for
  a workgroup. This improved the time to run this program for our test network from
  30seconds at best down to 15 seconds at best.
- More logging
- call _exit instead of exit() because i've seen a deadlook where two threads were
  inside exit(). _exit doesn't call only handlers.

- Moved the code for apopen()/apclose()/ into a apopen.c
- refactored some code into apopen_shutdown()
- Have the a* functions do the locking on their own.

- use sigwait() instead of a signal handler + polling of a variable.
- write the pid of the thread (implemented as process) into the pidfile
   so AVOS can signal the right process. (LinuxThreads aren't posix
   conform in that. It shouldn't matte who get the signal. The NPLT
   are doing the right thing.

Still some work to be done in regards to shutting down on USB
plugin.

Also use our custom version of popen()/pclose().
After doing this i haven't seen hanging fusesmb.cache
processes anymore.

Tested around 30 runs under different load situations
(samba uploading, audioplayer running, ...).

Contains a custom version of popen()/pclose()
which give us access to the list of childs.

When we wan't to shutdown all childs created we can call
apopen_shutdown().

Not quite ready yet.

Hopefully fixed some deadlock issues with the fusesmb.cache program.

1. It called into libsmbclient (which isn't thread safe) from several
    threads without any locking. Now there is a big fat lock. Doesn't make
    it faster but i haven't seen any dead locks since than *knock*knock*
2. There were problems when running popen in one thread was interleaved
     with the creation of a new thread. That might be a side effect of 1.
     but to be on the safe side if first create all threads needed and than
     have them use popen.

Also started to work on a better shutdown. If usb is plugged we need
to kill all instances of fusesbm.cache and it's childs. Killing all childs
was tricky because when using popen we can't access the pids.
Basically i ripped the popen code from the uclibc giving us access
to all the pids of all childs.
This part is still work in progress and not activated.
